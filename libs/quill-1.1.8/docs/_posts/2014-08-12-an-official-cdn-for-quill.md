title: An Offical CDN for Quill
---

Quill now has an offical Content Distribution Network so you can have access to a reliable, high-speed host for the library. To include a file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.quilljs.com/0.16.0/quill.snow.css" />
```
```html
<script src="//cdn.quilljs.com/0.16.0/quill.min.js"></script>
```

You can also use "latest" as the version:

```html
<script src="//cdn.quilljs.com/latest/quill.min.js"></script>
```
